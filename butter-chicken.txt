MyFitnessPal: "KetoConnect - Keto Butter Chicken"

Alternative protein: lamb or paneer

Ingredients:
- 1 lb chicken breast
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream
- 2 tbsp butter
- 1.5 tbsp tomato paste
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1/4 medium onion, diced
- 1.5 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp ground ginger
- 1 tsp pink salt
- 3/4 tsp chili powder
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon

Instructions:

- Cut the chicken up into bite sized chunks and generously coat them in the
  turmeric, ginger, salt, chili powder and cinnamon. Set aside in a bowl.

- Heat a skillet to medium heat and add the butter. As the butter melts dice the
  onion and garlic and add it to the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the onions
  are translucent and fragrant.

- Increase the pan heat to medium-high and add the chicken. Cook it almost
  entirely through - the outside should be white and this will take about 3-5
  minutes.

- Once the chicken looks almost fully cooked add in the heavy whipping cream and
  tomato paste. Using a spatula mix in the tomato paste so it runs smooth
  through the heavy whipping cream. It should be an orange color at this
  point. Turn the heat to medium-low and cover with a lid for 5-7 minutes.

- Remove lid and combine. The chicken is fully cooked and you should be able to
  eat it. However, if you like a thicker curry sauce allow it to reduce with the
  lid off until it reaches the consistency you like.

- Serve with low carb naan or over cauliflower rice. Enjoy!

- NOTE: You can store the butter chicken in a sealed container for up to 10 days
  in the fridge and 2 months in the freezer. You can also use chicken thighs
  instead of breast for a higher fat content.
