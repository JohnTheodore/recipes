Pork Rind Chicken Parmesan

"Chicken parmesan with crushed pork rind and parmesan crust."

Ingredients:
- 2 lb chicken breast
- 4 oz pork rinds
- 4 oz parmesan cheese
- 3 eggs
- 1/2 cup marinara sauce
- 8 oz mozzarella
- 3 tbsp butter
- salt
- pepper
- garlic powder

Directions:
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
- Crush pork rinds and parmesan cheese in a food processor.  Don't blend too long or else the mixture will become wet.  You want it to be coarsely crumbled/ground.
- Add salt and pepper to the "breading".
- Pour pork rind and parmesan "breading" mixture into shallow dish.
- Cut chicken breasts in half to make them thin, like a butterfly.  The chicken must be under half an inch everywhere so that it can cook evenly.
- Roll or pound cut chicken breasts between sheets of parchment paper or low-density polyethylene plastic wrap to make them thinner.
- Beat 3 eggs in a bowl and set it next to the "breading".
- Submerge one chicken breast at a time into the egg wash.
- Press chicken breast firmly into the "breading" dish, covering all sides well.
- Place "breaded" chicken breast between parcement paper, and press the "breading" into the chicken so it sticks better.
- Let the "breaded" chicken rest for 10 minutes.
- On medium high heat, melt 3 tbsp of butter.
- Place chicken breast in pan and cook until each side is golden brown and crunchy, about 2.5 min for each side.
- Pour 1/4 cup marinara sauce on the center of each chicken breast.
- Place 4 oz mozzarella on top of marinara sauce for each chicken breast.
- Salt and pepper mozzarella.
- Place browned chicken breast on a pan or cookie sheet, and bake for 15-30 min.
